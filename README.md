## Cool Features.
1. Minimal - vm-mgr is cli based, meaning it uses as little resources as possible!
2. Can run VM's with less than 64MB ram. - Some other VM managers set the min memory for a VM to 64MB!
3. Can run VM's with more threads. - Some other VM managers set the max threads to what the host has.
4. It uses the terminal. - Makes the terminal even more powerful.
5. BSD support - vm-mgr **plans** to add BSD support!

## Todo:

- [ ] Add BSD support.
- [x] Make menus more clear.
- [x] Fix bugs.
- [ ] Bridge the network.
- [ ] Enable starting created vms without disks and only isos/imgs.
- [x] Add *.img support.
